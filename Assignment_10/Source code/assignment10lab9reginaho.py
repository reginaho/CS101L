## PROBLEM : Describe the problem
## will ask the user for a text file to read.  Youâ€™ll want to read all the words and output a count of the words that are used the most.  
#
# ALGORITHM : 
## Step 1: import operator
## Step 2: take punctuation from string
## step 3: use while loop to ask for the file to open, if it does not exist, tell the user to try again.
## Step 4: read the file, strip the punctuation using for loops, nested for loops.
## Step 5: use if else statement to check if the length of the key is greater or equal to 3.
## Step 6: count both the lower and upper case, return the number of times that the word appears.
## Step 7: count the word that only appear once, and count unique words.
##
#Step 5: print out main()
##

## ERROR HANDLING:
##      Any Special Error handling to be noted.  Wager not less than 0. etc

## OTHER COMMENTS:
##      Any special comments
